Compilation of the Czech part from existing resources was supported by the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (grant no. LM2023044: Large Research, Development and Innovation Infrastructures). The task would be much harder without the source GECCC corpus, due to Jakub Náplava, Milan Straka and Jana Straková. Morevover, the result would be much smaller, less varied, or non-existent without previously built learner corpora, due to Karel Šebesta, Svatava Škodová, Barbora Štindlová, Jirka Hana and many others.
