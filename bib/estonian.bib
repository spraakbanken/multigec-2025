    abstract = "We present a case study on building task-specific models for grammatical error correction and explanation generation tailored to learners of Estonian. Our approach handles whole paragraphs instead of sentences and leverages prompting proprietary large language models for generating synthetic training data, addressing the limited availability of error correction data and the complete absence of correction justification/explanation data in Estonian. We describe the chosen approach and pipeline and provide technical details for the experimental part. The final outcome is a set of open-weight models, which are released with a permissive license along with the generated synthetic error correction and explanation data."
