    abstract = "The annotation of learner language is an often ambiguous and challenging task. It is therefore surprising that in Second Language Acquisition research, information on annotation quality is hardly ever published. This is also true for verb placement, a linguistic feature that has re- ceived much attention within SLA. This paper presents an annotation on verb placement in German learner texts at different proficiency levels. We argue that as part of the annotation process target hypotheses should be provided as ancillary annotations that make explicit each annotator{'}s interpretation of a learner sentence. Our study demonstrates that verb placement can be annotated with high agreement between multiple annotators, for texts at all proficiency levels and across sentences of varying complex- ity. We release our corpus with annotations by four annotators on more than 600 finite clauses sampled across 5 CEFR levels."
